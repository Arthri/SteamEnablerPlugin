# SteamEnablerPlugin
SteamEnablerPlugin is a plugin that turns on Steam for OTAPI.

# Installation
Get the [latest](/Arthri/SteamEnablerPlugin/releases/latest) release and put it in the `ServerPlugins` folder

## Dependencies
SteamEnablerPlugin requires `CSteamworks.dll` and `steam_api.dll` to work. Both files can be found in your Terraria directory

# Usage
Copy either `start-server-steam-friends` or `start-server-steam-private`, or both to the server directory.

Run `start-server-steam-friends` to start a server where your friends can use the "Join Game" button. And the `start-server-steam-private` where you need to send an invite
