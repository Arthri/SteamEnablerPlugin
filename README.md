# SteamEnablerPlugin
SteamEnablerPlugin is a plugin that turns on Steam for OTAPI.

# Setup
1. Get the [latest](/Arthri/SteamEnablerPlugin/releases/latest) release
2. Place it in the `ServerPlugins` folder
3. Locate Terraria's directory
4. Copy `CSteamworks.dll`, `steam_api.dll`, and `steam_appid.txt` to the same directory as `TerrariaServer.exe`(the TShock one)

# Usage
Copy either `start-server-steam-friends` or `start-server-steam-private`, or both to the server directory.

Run `start-server-steam-friends` to start a server where your friends can use the "Join Game" button. And the `start-server-steam-private` where you need to send an invite
